#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)
'''
A B     (A AND B)    (NOT B)   (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
T T     T            F         T
T F     F            T         T
F T     F            F         F
F F     F            T         T

#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
daylight = int(input("What is the number on the daylight sensor threshold? "))
if daylight < 8:
    print("Headlights On")
else:
    print("Headlights Off")
#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.
balance = float(input("What is your bank balance? $"))
if balance < 100:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
if age > 18:
    print("You can see R rated movies.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You can see PG-13 rated movies.")
else:
    print("You can see G rated movies.")
#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
subtotal = float(input("Please enter your order subtotal: $"))
if subtotal >= 50:
    print("Your order total is $" + str(subtotal))
else:
    print("Your order total is $" + str(subtotal + 5))
